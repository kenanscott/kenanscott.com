    <h3>DTS as a Whole</h3>
    <h5>Kenan Scott<br>15 June 2014</h5>
    <p>I don't think I could ever be able to fully express what God has done in my life the past six months, this will be my attempt in writing.</p>
    <p>Around the middle of 2013 I had a strong desire to do a Discipleship Training School with Youth with a Mission. YWAM is an international group of Christians dedicated to knowing God and making him known, the largest missionary group worldwide. Discipleship
      Training School (DTS) is a six month long course, the first three months are lecture phase, filled with teaching on God and the Bible, who God is and how he sees the world. The last three months are the outreach phase, going to different places
      and telling others what we learned about Jesus.</p>
    <p>In the Fall of 2013 I applied for a DTS in Harpenden, England and was accepted into the January 2014 school. I wanted to go somewhere that was English speaking but far away enough to be out of my comfort zone. Sure enough it was, I had to adjust to
      the culture, learn how to make a foreign place my home and find family far away from my family I had lived with all my life.</p>
    <p>The family God had placed me in for that time was twenty-two other students and eight staff from countries all over the world and in different places in their life. The YWAM location where we lived is an oval of buildings around a green field in the
      English countryside. At first it was awkward meeting all these people but soon we all came to be friends.</p>
    <p>The lecture phase included teaching, practical work, outreaches in the town, fun and getting to know each other and God more. The teaching covered a whole range of topics including "Missions and the Abrahamic Covenant", "Bible Study", "Sin, the Cross
      and Repentance", "Spiritual Warfare", "Father Heart of God", "Identity", "Freedom" and more. Each week had a topic and it was taught by a different speaker. The teaching was amazingly helpful and interesting, I learned a lot about God and who I
      am in his eyes. I learned a lot about the Bible and how to read it more effectively, I never thought I would find Leviticus interesting yet I do now! On the weekdays I would do work such as writing for our school's blog, cleaning and gardening.
      I also helped at a local youth drop-in every week.</p>
    <p>In March I went to a city called Derby for a week, north of where we lived. There we learned a lot more about telling people about Jesus on the streets. We went around the city, sharing Jesus' love through hot chocolate, talking and praying. That
      week we saw forty people come to know Christ!</p>
    <p>About half-way into lecture phase we were given two choices of which country to go on outreach to. The choice was between Romania and Thailand, I didn't know too much about either. I didn't have much reason to choose one or the other but I felt a
      very strong direction from God to go to Romania. So even though all I knew about Romania was where it was on the map I chose to go there.</p><img src=images/team.jpg>
    <p>In the beginning of April I went to Romania, there were ten people on the team. The first location I was at was Mediaș, located in Transylvania, central Romania. We were with the YWAM base there, working alongside their various ministries. I did a
      lot of children's work, going into different schools teaching them Bible stories, math and having fun. A lot of the children's work I did was with the Roma Gypsy people. The Roma ethnic group are throughout Europe, they are usually living at a very
      low standard. The Roma kids we worked with in Mediaș lived in a house with only a few women, usually the older kids (around 12 years old) would take care of the babies and younger children. It was great to play games with them, to give a little
      piece of what it means to be a child. There a little girl accepted Jesus into her heart, it was so precious to be a part of that.</p>
    <p>In Mediaș I also worked with various youth groups, sharing my testimony, teaching lessons, playing games and talking. Often most of these youth aren't Christians, since there isn't much to do in the villages they come to the church and hang out, it's
      an honor to be given that time with them.</p><img src=images/girl.jpg>
    <p>The next place was Medgidia, a small town in southeastern Romania. I worked with an organization called Stepping Stones, they serve the local Roma kids in many ways, the most important: feeding them, clothing them and giving them showers. In Romania
      if a child doesn't have a birth certificate then they can't attend school, since most Roma kids don't and since their culture doesn't support that kind of education the children won't usually go to school. I got to work alongside them, helping kids
      go to school, teaching a little of what they would learn in school if they went. I got to see three kids come to Christ after a testimony and Bible lesson we had, it was amazing to see.</p>
    <p>I didn't expect to be able to work with Turkish people in Medgidia, it was a great opportunity. I think that was part of the reason God had me go there. I did a lot of the same kind of work with them, teaching them Bible stories, school lessons, playing
      games. One of my favorite moments was worship at the Turkish church, singing actual Turkish songs, not just English translations.</p><img src=images/school.jpg>
    <p>Afterwards I went to the last part of my outreach in Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland is split into two countries, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland which is a part of the United Kingdom. For many years there has been tension between
      people who want to be a part of the Republic (Catholics) and people who want to be part of the UK (Protestants). Their religion is what they find their identity in for this matter, though most people aren't practicing. During the sixties through
      nineties there was extreme violence between both sides, thousands of people died including non-combatants. After the Good Friday Agreement most of the violence stopped, however, there is still fear and division throughout the countries.</p>
    <p>In Belfast we lived right next to a Catholic/Protestant border where a protest has been going on for over two hundred days so there were always police and armored vehicles around. There I did a lot of talking with people in the street, going door
      to door and sharing Jesus' love. I went to youth drop-ins a lot, they usually were not Christians but it was really great to see them hanging out with us and being honest about what they feel about Christians.</p>
    <p>The last Sunday that we were there was amazing. Quite a few people came that we invited and three people encountered Jesus and gave their lives to him! I look forward to the day when we see peace in Ireland with no fear of others.</p>
    <p>Overall I learned a lot about God and myself. I am closer to God than before, I have a much deeper relationship and foundation with him. I am excited for the future and what God has for me which I'll talk about more later. I've changed a lot in the
      past six months, I can't wait to see everyone from back home again and hear what you have been doing, we can have lunch and catch up.</p>
    <p>I'm really glad God let me do this DTS, it's been the best experience of my life and I know there's even better things ahead. More to come on what I'm doing afterwards soon!</p>
