    <h3>Using Spotify on Lubuntu 12.04.5 with a Non-SSE2 CPU</h3>
    <h5>Kenan Scott<br>14 March 2015</h5>
    <p>Recently I acquired a computer which is ancient as far as laptops go, the Sony PCG-FXA63 was low-end for its time. The best operating system I could give it was Lubuntu 12.04.5 but still it runs extremely slowly.</p>
    <p>Since I travel often I have been using Spotify for a while now and this laptop would be great for it, at least I thought. Turns out, running Spotify on an old laptop such as this one is very difficult but still possible with effort.</p>
    <p> The problem here is that the CPU on my laptop doesn't have <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2>SSE2. </a> Read the Wikipedia article but basically SSE2 makes programs way better and modern computers all have it. The Spotify Linux client only
      works on CPUs with SSE2, same with Windows apparently because it won't run with WINE.</p>
    <p>However, Spotify has a <a href=https://play.spotify.com>web player</a> available so we can just use that. But wait, you need Adobe Flash to run it!? I don't even know what function it serves but we need it. Adobe stopped supporting Flash for Linux
      a while ago, it's a dying technology anyways. We can get the latest developed build of the plugin but then we meet our old friend, you guessed him, it's SSE2, the plugin you download on the Adobe site only works on SSE2 processors. </p>
    <p> We might give up at this point but someone thought of us and there's an older version of the Adobe Flash plugin available <a href=https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kenanscottsite/libgcflashplayer.so>here</a> which supports non-SSE2 CPU and it works
      with Spotify Web Player. </p>
    <p>Now if you need it, I'll give a step-by-step guide to using Spotify Web Player with Firefox 35.01 on Lubuntu 12.04.5. This can be applied to other distributions of Linux/Ubuntu as well depending.</p>
    <p>Computer specifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Model - Sony VAIO PCG-FXA63 (released in 2002)</li>
      <li>Operating System - Lubuntu 12.04.5 (updated)</li>
      <li>CPU - Mobile AMD Athlon XP 1600+</li>
      <li>RAM - 512MB</li>
      <li>Display - Integrated graphics (1024 &#215;768)</li>
      <li>Network - Ethernet 10/100Mbps</li>
      <li>Browser - Firefox 35.01</li>
    </ul>
      <p>I'm going to be using Firefox since it is still being updated for non-SSE2 CPUs and I want a secure connection for my Spotify credentials. However, it runs on the slow side.
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be sure that your operating system is updated, if there is a problem later it might be because you haven't updated.</li>
          <li>Install Mozilla Firefox. In the terminal (Control-Alt-T):
            <br><code>sudo apt-get install firefox</code></li>
          <li>Run Firefox and make sure that it works, it may be very sluggish so have patience. When you're done, close Firefox if you don &#8217;t want to use it for the next step.</li>
          <li>Go to the download for the old Adobe Flash Plugin <a href="../libgcflashplayer.so">here.</a> Download the file to your Downloads folder.</li>
          <li>In terminal (Control-Alt-T):<code>cd Downloads</code> to navigate to your Downloads folder, or <code>cd /home/(yourusername)/Downloads</code>. <code>sudo mv libgcflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla/libflashplayer.so</code> uses sudoed root privileges to move the plugin file to the Firefox plugins directory and renames it. If you&#8217;re using a 64 bit operating system for some reason this folder will be different, look it up for your OS.</li>
          <li>Open or restart Firefox, click the menu, usually at the top-right and then click Add-ons. Select Plugins from the left and verify that Shockwave Flash 11.2r202 is installed and has Always Activate selected.
          <li>Now go to <a href=https://play.spotify.com>https://play.spotify.com</a>, you should be able to login and play your music. It is extremely sluggish for me but actual playback is flawless by my reckoning.</li>
        </ol>
