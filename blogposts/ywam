    <h3>YWAM!</h3>
    <h5>Kenan Scott<br>17 December 2013</h5>
    <p>In a little less than a month I will be starting Discipleship Training School (DTS) with Youth with a Mission (YWAM). I’m really excited for this opportunity, I’ve been wanting to do this for about two years.</p>
    <p>YWAM is a missions Christian organization whose mission is to know God and make Him known. DTS is the starting program with YWAM, the first part of it is learning more about God and growing in relationship with Him and the second part is going somewhere
      to tell others about Him. I’ll be going to England for the training! I’m excited to see the country for the first time and experience the difference in culture.</p>
    <p>That’s about it for now, I’ll be making occasional posts throughout DTS from time to time, as well as photos in an upcoming gallery.</p>
