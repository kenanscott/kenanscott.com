    <h3>What Comes Next?</h3>
    <h5>Kenan Scott<br>19 April 2014</h5>
    <p>A year ago I couldn't imagine that I would be in Romania talking to people about Jesus but here I am. What I was doing a year ago was quite valuable, not a waste of time, even though it sometimes felt like it. I didn't feel like I belonged there,
      I wanted to really help people but it didn't feel like I was doing that.Right now I'm feeling fulfilled in what I'm doing. Telling people about the good news of Jesus is exciting and awesome. However, I don't have any plans yet for after I finish
      my DTS. There are a few things I know, one is that God has an awesome plan in store for me but I don't know what it is yet. Two, I don't want to slow down and do something I don't feel purpose in.</p>
    <p>I think plans are great, goals are great, you should have direction in life. It's hard for me right now because I don't have a plan. I could think of something to do off the top of my head but God's idea is better. I'm asking God what he has for me
      but I haven't heard anything specific yet.</p>
    <p>What I do believe he is telling me to do is wait and for now keep my primary focus on what I'm doing in Romania and Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p>So for now, I have no plan, but I'll keep asking God and give any anxiety I have to him. When I hear the next step I must have faith to step into it.</p>
