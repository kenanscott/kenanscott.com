We had to clear lots of equipment and clean many different spaces around the Oval. I walked from the Clock Building over towards the marquee (a big tent), where there were others gathered waiting for jobs to do. As I approached, I saw that Makayla was standing between me and the others. She saw me walking in her general direction and what she did next was unexpected. Makayla raised her right arm and extended her hand to me, I could tell that she seemed tired and probably needed a boost. But at the same time, I needed to get to where I was going so that we could finish up the work for the day. Then, an idea struck me, I continued to walk her way, slightly to the left of her, but with even greater speed. As I got closer, I raised my right arm as well, grabbed her hand, let go and propelled both of us in the opposite direction. What a strange story, it all happened in about fifteen seconds. I look at it as a physical example of how our class can work together to be propelled into God’s calling for us, even if we aren’t going in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As we were cleaning up on Monday after the WISE (Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England) Gathering this past weekend, we were all engaged in various tasks.

This is a an annual children’s holiday in Turkey to celebrate the people of the future. It has been celebrated in Turkey for about a hundred years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About ten of us from YWAM Harpenden went to the church by car, we set up in the church hall. Much Turkish food had been prepared, which was great to eat and provided lots of interesting tastes. We played games with the kids at first, had a dance competition and then finished with crafts. The craft that I helped with were paper plate face masks, other crafts were flower pots, cupcake decorating and colouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/children.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Children running&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was a lot of fun and showed me more of what the church is like in London, especially for immigrants. The kids were full of energy and enjoyed the time that is set aside for them. It was also really good to meet with new people and hear their stories. I am really glad that I went and stepped out into something unknown. I hope to go back again sometime soon and continue in serving the Turkish people in London.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Last Sunday, I had the opprotunity to help facilitate a Çocuk Bayramı holiday for a Turkish-speaking church in London.

A worldview is a set of assumpitons held consciously or unconsciously in faith about the makeup of the world and how it works. In essence, it is the story we tell to explain the world. There are many worldviews out there but the categories that we focused on were Biblical theism, Animism and secularism/humanism. Before we started looking at the specifics of these worldviews, we learned about how important it is to not just tell others truth, but to really live and share it through actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/child-with-bible.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A child with a Bible&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we are Christians, it can be possible that we have a partial worldview rooted in something besides the Bible. This is one of the importances of studying worldview, so that we know what we believe and why, to cast off anything that isn’t of God. We walked through four questions and how each worldview would answer them: what are the origins of everything? What is humanity? What is the world? What is our ultimate destiny? It was very helpful to me to hear the different worldviews and understand that biblical truth gives hope and redemption for humanity. We were created intentionally by a Creator God and we are co-laboring with him to bring restoration to all things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Our lectures on Monday and Tuesday this week were on Biblical Worldview with Rebekah Hodder.

The author, John Ortberg explains these points in the form of a story of his different stories about Dallas Willard. It begins with information on what the soul is and how it can become polluted. Then, he writes about how to take care of your soul in many ways. The book ends with the story of Dallas Willard’s death and the state of his soul during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soul Keeping showed me the importance of caring for my inner life and that it will affect everything that I am. I was inspired by a story in the book that told of a man who cared for streams of water that flowed down into a village. Without that care, the village became sick from poluted waters. The village represents all of myself and the water flowing down represents my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also inspired by me showing the difference between being busy and hurried. Being busy isn’t bad by itself, it can point me to God for strength. Being hurried however keeps me focusing on myself and drains me spiritually. The hurried mentality also keeps me from focusing on what I am doing and instead I am preoccupied by other things on my mind. Solitude can provide rest for the soul, I appreciated this, “Solitude provides shelter from noise and distraction, and that can be scary. We have become almost addicted to both.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the part where John Ortberg talks about the soul’s need of a centre, meaning a purpose. We can get easily caught up in what we do and how we do it, but why do we do things? Without a clear centre in my life, I will become impatitent and easily lost. Through focusing on the why, I can be more confident in daily decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was challenged by the writings about keeping your soul close to God, to draw from his strength and his words. If I intentionally choose to be in the presence of God, my soul will be in a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I appreciated being introduced to the life of Dallas Willard through this book, I did not know of him previously. I may read one of his books one day now, he seems like a very wise man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this book was quite difficult to read, I failed to connect with it on a deeper level. I’m not quite sure why this is, it may be that I wasn’t really hearing the author’s stories as much as his quotes of Dallas Willard or others. The author’s stories of Dallas Willard aren’t very detailed and seem to be only there to get to the conversations they had. I view this book as partially a biography of Dallas Willard which is somewhat interesting in its way. For me, I walk away from this book with a renewed calling to live a life that cares for my soul, but in a very academic way, not personal. I’m not saying that it is bad, just that I failed to connect with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reading the book, I thought about other similar books that I had connected deeply with and what the differences might be that I connected with them and not this one. I think that I can really connect to books that emphasise good storytelling and some explaination with encouragement for practical steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my ministries I am reminded to make sure that my soul is taken care of, but in my opinion the book is inner-focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have been quite critical, I do believe that I am better off having read the book Soul Keeping, rather than not reading it at all. What is the soul you may ask? I don’t know if I can answer that question in a detailed, accurate way. What I can tell you is that the soul is who you are, not your body, and it requires your upmost care. Entrust your soul to Father God and allow him to continue his work, “(Jesus) forever made perfect those who are being made holy.”, Hebrews 10:14.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The book, Soul Keeping, is about how to care for your soul, the innermost part of yourself that is not a part of your body.

Spiritual formation is simply becoming more and more of a reflection on Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day we looked at the spiritual formation of Samuel in the Bible. Samuel grew up in a context of people who did not know God closely at all and were indifferent to him. Yet, he was formed by the intimate time he spent with God, his humility and his service to others. As he grew into a leader, people knew him for being authentic and credible, “He is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true.” - 1 Samuel 9:6. We also see throughout Samuel’s life that he was fully engaged in the society around him, he was not a guru that was distant from the world, he stayed relevant. His legacy from his spiritual formation is that he realigned the nation to godly values, influenced the country’s power structures (King Saul and David) and led in hearing the voice of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the week we talked about different spiritual disciplines to grow in our intimacy with God. A few examples are prayer, silence before God, journaling, studying the Bible and more. Lastly, Emmanuel taught on guidance and being resilient. This part impacted me the most, especially in three points to be attentive to when processing through guidance form the Lord. Be rooted in the unchanging nature of God and his Word when taking steps. Process through guidance in community of brothers and sisters in Christ. Reflect God’s caring nature in following guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/reflection.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A reflection of a tree&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I continue in my walk with God, I will be open and vulnerable to him to allow him to work in my life and make me a better reflection of Christ each day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Our first week of lectures on the School of Ministry Development was Emmanuel Entee teaching on spiritual formation, but what does that even mean?

We do life together; working, eating, studying and having fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Karen, a fellow staff member, invited me to brunch. Two others from the School of Ministry Development went as well as many from around the base. Wow, there was a lot of food, Karen is American and the selection reflected that. There was bacon, eggs, fruit, cookies, blueberries, cobbler, coffee and juice. We talked a little about new life, blueberries and breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy these times very much and in different ways. It is fun to be around friends and enjoy a meal together, we laugh quite a lot in these times. These times of being together is relaxing, especially after a long week. It is good to slow down after a week of being busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deeper experience is that I feel closer to God when I am around other brothers and sisters in these times. I can see more of him when I can see him in the lives of believers. We have been learning this week about the importance of community in developing our spiritual foundation. The early church lived this out each day, they knew that they needed one another. “No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us.” - 1 John 4:12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the Father’s face even more clearly, get to know a brother while eating bacon together.

I’m very excited to grow in these upcoming months along with the eight other trainees and four staff. Yesterday, we went on a treasure trail in Chesham, a market town about an hour from here. This outing was a good reflection of some of what to expect during this school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/chesham-high-street.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chesham High Street&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal for the treasure trail was to find out where Bob lost his boots. We had a list of locations where Bob’s boots could be and twenty clues to help us cross off incorrect places. To do that we had to follow directions to places around Chesham and then solve the clue. In the end, we didn’t get the correct answer. That was disappointing, but it didn’t matter, the journey was more important than the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole experience was a lot of fun but there were some difficult moments. There were a few times when we didn’t know how to solve the clue or where to go, but each time we decided how we should move forward as a team. I grew to know my fellow trainees a lot more, understanding who they are individually. It wasn’t necessarily in a way that I could write down or think about consciously but to know them intrinsically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these next four months, there will be a lot of times when we don’t know what we should do. There will be times when I won’t know what I need to do to support the others. There will be times when I don’t feel like going on. But that is alright because we are Spirit-filled brothers and sisters who are in this together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve started the School of Ministry Development at YWAM Harpenden!

I was to read all of the Bible, the New Testament and then onto the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-method&quot;&gt;The Method&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a simple 2013 NLT paperback recently purchased for this purpose but instead of reading normally as I might any other book, I decided to follow a method taught to me by others that I know. I would use coloured pencils to mark and diagram what was written. This gave several benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The process made me slow down, reading every word as I very often gloss over pages of text, missing all but the basic ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The markings help tremendously both in understanding the structure of the book and helping me when looking back to review a section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I could more easily find certain parts of the Bible because I knew where they are located on the page, even if I don’t know the specific page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reading the New Testament there are many quotes of the Old Testament. I would write where a passage was quoted on the appropriate page in the Old Testament. This was extremely helpful when I went back to read the Old Testament and was able to better interpret using the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when there are two or more books which told about the same events I would write out the cross-reference. For example: the Gospels or the books referencing Israel/Judah’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-reading&quot;&gt;The Reading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the whole Bible through was difficult, these books in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exodus 20-Deuteronomy. Most of this is law, although Numbers has more linear story than the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 and 2 Chronicles. A lot of this is the previous books, 1 Samuel - 2 Kings but again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isaiah-Jeremiah. The Major prophets are all together so the long books can become tiring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though these were difficult sections, I am glad I read through them, the value is tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the New Testament because it gives a lamp to the Old. In the Old Testament times there was a great Mystery, which we now know as the Mystery of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when the prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you. They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ’s suffering and his great glory afterward. They were told that their messages were not for themselves but for you. And now this Good News had been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit from heaven.
1 Peter 1:10-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is no reason that I can see to read the Old Testament without even the basic knowledge of the announcement of this salvation. But ultimately, it is all useless to read if I don’t allow the Holy Spirit to speak to me and allow God to mold me through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all took a little over a year to complete, using coloured pencils in everything I read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-takeaway&quot;&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up in church I suppose I thought I knew everything that was in the Bible already but I most certainly did not. A few highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not sweep life away; instead, he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him.” - 2 Samuel 14:14&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;God’s heart for the nations is throughout the whole Bible, not just when we get to The Great Commission.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;God warned his people so much and gave them so many chances to repent until they were sent into exile, but still there was the clear hope for their return and reconciliation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jesus is throughout the Old Testament as well but only mentioned in brief snippets. You can see that hope built up for when we get to the Gospels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In general, the amount of time between events feels a lot longer than when you’re just flipping through. These are thousands of years we’re working with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-conclusion&quot;&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the whole Bible was an extremely valuable pursuit for me and I’m glad that God taught me throughout the process. I will move onto the New Testament now again, as many people have said, every time you read the Bible you will find something new.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In March of 2015 I began a journey through God’s word as I had never done before.
