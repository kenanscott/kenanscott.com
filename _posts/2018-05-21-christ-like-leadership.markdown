This past week we had the pleasure of having Judy Orred teaching our School of Ministry Development class on the topic of Christ-like Leadership. I really enjoyed her teaching and how she explored different topics with us, helping us grow, and didn't come with material that she had to get through. Judy Orred is from YWAM Kona and she has a lot of experience in leadership, some of my favourite times were hearing her speak about what she has done in the past and learned from.

We talked a lot about truth in the class and its weight. Truth demands a response, to be loyal or not. God tells us what we need to hear and not more because we need proper foundations in our life to handle that truth properly, for instance, the foundation of knowing your identity in the Father.

Another thing that I really liked was when she talked about fearing God instead of fearing people. We can have great confidence in a leader who fears God more than most, as Nehemiah did, "I gave the responsibility of governing Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, for he was a faithful man who feared God more than most."
