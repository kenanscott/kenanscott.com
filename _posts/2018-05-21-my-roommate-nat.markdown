Today I'd like to tell you a little bit about my roommate and friend, Nat. His real name is Nathaniel, aka Nat, aka Nate-Dog (but I never hear anyone call him that). Nat is an English man from the southern part of the country, Chestershire, it's actually part of the dukedom of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. There is a also a famous cathedral in the city of Chestershire.

I first met Nat after he got back from staffing a DTS outreach, I got to know him just a little before he left on holiday. But when he came back we started the School of Ministry Development together and have gotten to know him much better since.

The room in which we live is called The Kenat House and we only have six rules:
* No drugs
* No smoking
* No kids
* Yes to smelling good
* Yes to cleanliness (which is next to godliness)
* Yes to **not** peeing the bed

Nat is a very chilled person who takes things day by day. He's learning to play guiitar and loves reading the Bible and books about the Bible. Nat is a skilled drummer and loves God, ladies, he's single, think about it.
