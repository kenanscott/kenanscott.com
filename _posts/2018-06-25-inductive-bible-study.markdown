Last week we had lectures on a couple of different topics, including how to do an Inductive Bible Study. Inductive Bible Study an approach of studying the Bible which looks at what the Bible says, asking lots of questions, and helping you apply what you learn. Contrast with deductive Bible study which is not neccesarily bad but approaches the Bible with a topic or question to be answered, making it easy to miss things.

The first step of Inductive Bible Study is Observation, asking the question, "what is written in the text?", without asking what it means, drawing conclusions, comparing it with other passages, etc. For this you can use coloured pencils to make it easy to understand the text that you are looking at. During Observation you can ask what words are used, who is mentioned, what locations are mentioned, where it is taking placing and who the author and reciepient is.

Next is Interpretation which asks, "What did it mean to the original reader?", not asking what it means to you or society today. This requires a lot of research to understand the historical context of the author and reciepient, using a lot of Bible resources, but it is very helpful because it provides information that we just wouldn't see by reading the text. For example, the churches that Paul wrote to were in very different cities, and he wrote to different kinds of people, this affected what he wrote because those letters were written to specific groups of people.

Lastly, Application is asking, "What does it mean to me?". This is the goal of the inductive method, if you don't do this step then you might as well not start at all because you just get a lot of knowledge but with no change in your life. In this step we are finding timeless truths, meaning, truths that were applicable to the original reader/hearer and to me and for everyone across all times and all cultures. In this step we ask, what the original text means to me, how can I apply it, what the original text means to my time in history, my community and my church.

I'm so glad that I heard this teaching, as Inductive Bible Study has been something I've heard about frequently but didn't know how to actually do it. I will defintely be implementing this into my Bible study times.
