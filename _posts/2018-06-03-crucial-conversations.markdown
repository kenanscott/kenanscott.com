The book, Crucial Conversations is written about having good conversations even if there are opposing opinions, strong emotions and high stakes involved. It is written by four authors, Kerry Patterson, Joseph Greeny, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler.

Throughout the book they discuss how to take responsibility and have crucial conversations. First they expertly define what a crucial conversation is, "A discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinions vary, and (3) emotions run strong." These conversations are very important, without them you may not be able to do well in your job, not be able to improve your organisation, lose relationships or even die. But our tendency is to avoid crucial conversations or handle them poorly.

Crucial conversations are not a one-sided monologue, it is a dialogue between at least two people. People need investment or meaning involved in decisions instead of being driven by fear, if they are being driven by fear then you miss out on their unique talents and abilities. In these situations of conflict, think, what do I really want? Then, "Work on me first, us second". It is important to look at the end goal because often we get caught up in the little things that no parties actually care about. Make sure your own motives are good and not looking to hurt others.

We also need to be able to observe our crucial conversations and see our own and other people's points of anger and learn to help guide through that. But we can make it safe to talk about almost anything because we can use mutual purpose and respect to show our real motives for others. These points of anger for ourselves our painful but if we can recognise them we can move past into something better for both ourselves and our teams. In the next section of the book we look at how to share our stories (or paths) and move into a place of understanding each other. Conversely, we also learn how to really listen to other people's stories, even through high emotions.

But all of this doesn't really mean much if we don't make a decision and more forward into action as a team. The book discusses four different types of decision making: Command (making a decision with no involvment whatsover), Consult (hearing other opinions and then making a decision), Vote or Consensus. These four decision making types all have their place and must be used appropriately, using them inappropriately will lead to anger and fires. The book ends with many examples of different crucial conversation stories.

This book really made a huge lasting impact on my life and I don't think I will ever be quite the same. The biggest huge impact that it had was just showing me that I can have crucial conversations well and it doesn't have to be a bad thing. In my life I will defintely use these concepts.

* A concept that I will use a lot is STATE (to share your path or story):
* Share your facts. Start with the least controversial, most persuasive elemeents from your path toAction.
* Tell your story. Explain what you're beginning to conclude.
* Ask for others' paths. Encourage others to share both their facts and their storeis.
* Talk tentatively. State your story as a story - don't disguise it as a fact.
* Encourage testing. Make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views.

Another point of impact for me personally is the chapter on moving to action, turing crucial conversations into action and results, to not just be in dialogue but to actually move forward was great encouragement and help for me. As well as the quote in the book by Ouida, "I have known a thousand scamps; but I never met one who considered himself so. Self-knowledge isn't so common." Oh if we would move past the point of just looking towards ourselves and our own needs and consider the needs of others, without trying to take responsibility for others but to them instead.
