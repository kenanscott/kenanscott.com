This past week we had two speakers in our School of Ministry Development, I enjoyed hearing from both speakers. They both helped us in preparing for outreach in both theory and practical ideas.

Laurence Singlehurst spoke on evangelism the first two days, he gave us personal stories as well as deeper ideas behind evangelism. He told us the story of Christianity in Britain since its beginning, about the different historical events and revivals in the land throughout the centuries. One of my big takeaways was that in outreach, to know that you may be preparing the ground to make it fertile soil, as in the parable of the seeds. Some groups of people in the world don't even know that God is good, this is something that we can show to them.

Another big takeaway I had from Laurence's teaching, which is related, is that we need to make sure that people know what they are doing when they accept Christ. "Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow. But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun, and since they didn't have deep roots, they died."

There is so much more and more depth but it is hard to put into words on this blog, this teaching will be very hel;pful for outreach and for future ministry.
