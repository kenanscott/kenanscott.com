I've started the School of Ministry Development at YWAM Harpenden! I'm very excited to grow in these upcoming months along with the eight other trainees and four staff. Yesterday, we went on a treasure trail in Chesham, a market town about an hour from here. This outing was a good reflection of some of what to expect during this school.

Our goal for the treasure trail was to find out where Bob lost his boots. We had a list of locations where Bob's boots could be and twenty clues to help us cross off incorrect places. To do that we had to follow directions to places around Chesham and then solve the clue. In the end, we didn't get the correct answer. That was disappointing, but it didn't matter, the journey was more important than the destination.

The whole experience was a lot of fun but there were some difficult moments. There were a few times when we didn't know how to solve the clue or where to go, but each time we decided how we should move forward as a team. I grew to know my fellow trainees a lot more, understanding who they are individually. It wasn't necessarily in a way that I could write down or think about consciously but to know them intrinsically.

During these next four months, there will be a lot of times when we don't know what we should do. There will be times when I won't know what I need to do to support the others. There will be times when I don't feel like going on. But that is alright because we are Spirit-filled brothers and sisters who are in this together.
