Celebration of Discipline is a lovely book which focuses on practical ways to grow spiritually in your life with God. It calls us from the shallow into deep spiritual waters. The book looks at twelve classic spiritual disciplines:

* Meditation
* Prayer
* Fasting
* Study
* Simplicity
* Solitude
* Submission
* Service
* Confession
* Worship
* Celebration

For each of these disciplines, the author Richard Foster examines the history of the discipline, its benefits, his personal experience and how to grow in the discipline over time. These disciplines are so important because they are practical building blocks of how to grow in relationship with Father God, not religous rites. Richard Foster also dicusses the potential danger or controversies of the discipline. At the end of each discipline chapter, he includes questions for reflection and provides sources for plenty of supplemental reading.

This book impacted me in that it challenged me to step from the superficial into deep waters. I am starting to practice these disciplines and I am finding much delight in the intimacy with God that I didn't have before.

One of my highlights was the discipline of meditation, which is simply slowing down and taking time to really conteplate. There isn't a special way to do it, aside from just deciding to start. I find this meditation very helpful, along with prayer, in focusing on the things that are important and silencing what is not important. Reading about different forms of meditation was also very interesting, for instance, meditating on Scripture, past events, God's creations and the events of our time.

Another was the discipline of fasting, I haven't explored fasting very much at all, I had wondered about what the practical steps are. Celebration of Discipline really helped by answering questions I had: how long do fasts last? what are the different kinds of fasts? How does it feel to be on a fast? Why should you fast? Is fasting a commandment? Thank you Richard Foster! I love this quote, "Fasting reminds us that we are sustained: 'by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God' (Matthew 4:4). Food does not sustain us; God sustains us. In Christ, 'All things hold together' (Colossians 1:17). Therefore, in experiences of fasting we are not so much abstaining from food as we are feasting on the word of God. Fasting is feasting!"

The discipline of confession was quite challenging for me, what a step! "The confession of evil works in the first beginning of good works." - Augustine of Hippo. Richard Foster focuses on the authority we've been given as believers to hear each other's sins and forgive.

The chapter on the discipline of guidance was a special blessing. What a joy it is to find counsel in many believers! I think it is a tendency to want to make decisions on my own and not involve others. Even though it is my responsibility, my decisions still affect others. Through the body of Christ, we can see more of the Father's heart.

I looked forward to the discipline of celebration as I neared the end of Celebration of Discipline. As we were reminded during our recent YWAM UK and Ireland gathering, seriousness is not a fruit of the Spirit, but joy is. Celebration is something to be celebrated, Jesus had a reputation for his celebrations. We can grow closer to God through celebrating his goodness together.

This book impacted me and will continue to impact me and by extension, ministries, in how I relate to God and others. I really don't look at life and ministry as being two different things, our school should really be called School of Development, in my opinion. Two thirds of these disciplines are directly related to others, and all can be applied to any believers I interact with. The challenge now is to walk out these principles in my life, not in fa way that focuses on actions but on relationship with Father and others. May he help me as I continue to walk this path with excellence and empower others to be stronger in their walks and abilities. "We look into the face of God until we ache with bliss, as Frank Laubach witnessed, 'I know what it means to be "God-intoxicated"'".
