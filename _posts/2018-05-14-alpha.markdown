Several years ago, a study was created to educate people, especially non-believers, on what Christians and the Bible are about. This is called Alpha, you might have heard of it, especiallyh if you are from the UK. This is a very cool tool which really goes into the basics of the Christian faith and invites people to think about the Gospel message. You can see more [here](https://alpha.org/).

As part of our School of Ministry Development, we have started Alpha groups for two age groups of kids from YWAM Harpenden. We start with a game and then watch the youth Alpha video. During the video there are three questions to create discussion in our groups. It is a great time, the kids really engage and we have good conversations.

I really enjoy doing Alpha with these kids and my friend Let√≠cia. It's cool to get to know the kids from YWAM Harpenden better. This is important to ground these kids in biblical truth and get them thinking about what Father is like. Be praying for us as we continue to walk with these kids in Alpha and give them what they will need in the future. See you next week with another story!
