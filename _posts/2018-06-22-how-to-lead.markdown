How to Lead When You're Not in Charge is a book written by Clay Scroggins, I chose to read this book as the last book on my School of Ministry Development. The book discusses the importance of leading with influence and relatinships, instead of title, position, power or money.

First, Clay Scroggins goes over why using your position often to lead from is a dangerous slope and not a mark of a good leader. It is also important to be yourself and not try to lead like someone that you're not. God has placed the mandate to subdue deep within us, but it is not what we may think of as crushing things beneath us, it is helping them grow. Genesis 1:28 says:

> Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground.”

And Jesus elborates on this in teaching his disciples in Matthew 20:

> “You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them. But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

Then Clay Scroggins goes into talking about the importance of leading yourself before you lead anyone else, and how to do that. If you can't lead yourself well, can you lead anyone else? This includes choosing posititivity in your attitude, thinking critically and rejecting passivity. He finishes the book with a section on how to start being a leader before you ever have position and to grow in your influence.

There were serveral parts of this book that really stood out to me, the first was in the foreward by Andy Stanley:

> Great leaders leverage influence and relationships over title and poisition. When a leader is left with nothing to leverage other than title and position, the end is near. The best leaders lead like they're not in charge, even when they are. The best leaders become the leaders by mastering the art of leading when you're not in charge.

What a great statement, that the best leaders lead like they're not in charge. "When people have to tell you that they're in charge in order for you to follow, you know instinctively that something has gone desparately wrong." The author talks about practice as "pulling the gun". This way of leading does not produce lasting results, people will eventually leave. This is also talked about in the book, The Five Levels of Leadership by John Maxwell, another great book which expounds on this topic. In the end, you want people to want to follow you, not forced to because of a threat. This is something that we have to operate with in YWAM because everyone is a volunteer, you can't hold the threat of losing a salary when we don't have it at all through the organisation itself.

Another point is that we have the ability to lead in doing things that no one else wants to do. We need to have active minds and hearts to go from doing what we're told to do, to also finding what we are going to do, and do it.

Clay Scroggins focuses on the importance of leading yourself well, before you are leading anyone else. I will expand on this below but for now, I was struck by the passage of Scripture that he referenced in Luke:

> If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities.

A way to be accountable to leading yourself well is to have deadlines where others are expecting you to have completed something and you just have to do it and lead yourself well.

The final highlight I will mention is that it is important not to be passive, you have a voice and need to speak up when something needs to change and you have a plan to change it.

Something that I keep thinking of is the importance of self-leadership, I've known this before of course but it feels more real now. It's a bit of a joke that I'm leading the IT department here at YWAM Harpenden, because I'm also the only one in the IT department here at YWAM Harpenden. Jason was my leader before he left but he never told me what to do, other than that I needed to decide what I was going to spend my time on. Through our collaboration we have done so much and took care of real needs without anyone dictating what we were to do each day. So even though I'm the only one, I am leading the IT department, I'm leading myself in what I choose to do each day, the attitude I have, and the culture that I create.
