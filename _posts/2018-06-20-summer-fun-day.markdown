This past Saturday we hosted an event here at the Oval called Summer Fun Day. This is an annual event where we invite families from Harpenden to come and eat, play games and other cool things. The local fire brigade even came and showed the truck to the kids!

I helped with the Fun Run and the Oval Run. The Fun Run is a mile long run for kids and families, it was really cool to see everyone getting out there and partaking in this fun event. The Oval Run is a five mile long run for adults which was quite awesome to see. How fast they run! Cesar and I gave the runners food and drink, like bananas, hob nobs, apple slices, and water When I saw them run, I thought, "I wish I could run like that."

I think that the next time that the Summer Fun Day somes along, I will look forward to participating. Not only did it have all of this, but we also had Brazillian Barbeque: steak, chips, nachos and some assorted fruits. It was quite delicious, but the time in the community was even better, just seeing everyone working together and bringing joy to the families around Harpenden.
