The book, Soul Keeping, is about how to care for your soul, the innermost part of yourself that is not a part of your body. The author, John Ortberg explains these points in the form of a story of his different stories about Dallas Willard. It begins with information on what the soul is and how it can become polluted. Then, he writes about how to take care of your soul in many ways. The book ends with the story of Dallas Willard's death and the state of his soul during that time.

Soul Keeping showed me the importance of caring for my inner life and that it will affect everything that I am. I was inspired by a story in the book that told of a man who cared for streams of water that flowed down into a village. Without that care, the village became sick from poluted waters. The village represents all of myself and the water flowing down represents my soul.

It also inspired by me showing the difference between being busy and hurried. Being busy isn't bad by itself, it can point me to God for strength. Being hurried however keeps me focusing on myself and drains me spiritually. The hurried mentality also keeps me from focusing on what I am doing and instead I am preoccupied by other things on my mind. Solitude can provide rest for the soul, I appreciated this, "Solitude provides shelter from noise and distraction, and that can be scary. We have become almost addicted to both."

I appreciated the part where John Ortberg talks about the soul's need of a centre, meaning a purpose. We can get easily caught up in what we do and how we do it, but why do we do things? Without a clear centre in my life, I will become impatitent and easily lost. Through focusing on the why, I can be more confident in daily decisions.

I was challenged by the writings about keeping your soul close to God, to draw from his strength and his words. If I intentionally choose to be in the presence of God, my soul will be in a good place.

Finally, I appreciated being introduced to the life of Dallas Willard through this book, I did not know of him previously. I may read one of his books one day now, he seems like a very wise man.

For me, this book was quite difficult to read, I failed to connect with it on a deeper level. I'm not quite sure why this is, it may be that I wasn't really hearing the author's stories as much as his quotes of Dallas Willard or others. The author's stories of Dallas Willard aren't very detailed and seem to be only there to get to the conversations they had. I view this book as partially a biography of Dallas Willard which is somewhat interesting in its way. For me, I walk away from this book with a renewed calling to live a life that cares for my soul, but in a very academic way, not personal. I'm not saying that it is bad, just that I failed to connect with it.

While reading the book, I thought about other similar books that I had connected deeply with and what the differences might be that I connected with them and not this one. I think that I can really connect to books that emphasise good storytelling and some explaination with encouragement for practical steps.

For my ministries I am reminded to make sure that my soul is taken care of, but in my opinion the book is inner-focused.

Although I have been quite critical, I do believe that I am better off having read the book Soul Keeping, rather than not reading it at all. What is the soul you may ask? I don't know if I can answer that question in a detailed, accurate way. What I can tell you is that the soul is who you are, not your body, and it requires your upmost care. Entrust your soul to Father God and allow him to continue his work, "(Jesus) forever made perfect those who are being made holy.", Hebrews 10:14.
