Last week Michael Green spoke to our class on the topic of self-leadership, it's all about living intentionally and not accidentally.

One of the subjects that really impacted me was the Five Gears, which are different states that you can be at throughout each day. 5th gear is focus mode, when you are working on one thing with all of your concentration. 4th gear is task mode when you are working on many different things at once. 3rd gear is social mode, when you are being around people casually. 2nd gear is connect mode when you are connecting with people on a deeper level. 1st gear is recharge mode when you are alone and doing what you need to be charged for the other gears. There is also reverse which is a responsive mode when you are going back and correcting for mistakes. These are significant because some gears are easier for others and some gears we are not as good at doing in a healthy way. It is important to make sure that you are in the correct gear, for instance, when we are eating dinner together in the dining hall, it is not a good time to be in 4th gear, working on tasks instead of socialising or connecting.

Michael also talked about the different voices that people have on a team, while some may be a loud, pioneering voice, we need to take time to hear those who will be quieter when decisions are being made. On our team we need to take time to hear from each of us and use our gifts to benefit others and not tear them down.
