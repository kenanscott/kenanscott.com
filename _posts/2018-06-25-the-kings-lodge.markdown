Last Sunday, five of us from the campus went on a road trip to The King's Lodge to visit two of our friends who are doing a Bible school there. We took a rental car over there, only about a hour and a half drive.

The King's Lodge is a beautiful YWAM location, it is out in the peaceful country. The lodge is two large buildings, I believe, with several stories. In the bottom centre is a beautiful lounge and cafe area, a worship space and dining hall.

We all had a wonderful time visiting for a few hours and seeing what life is like for our friends doing school there. I even got a painting out of the trip. I won't say who, but one of us deposited prawns in the bin of their cafe. This caused the whole area to stink for a while until someone traced the scent. Ha ha, I feel bad for them but I also appreciate the funny story that we can tell in future years. Until next time, God bless you all, God bless you Mary A., I enjoyed our breakfast on Saturday.
