Our first week of lectures on the School of Ministry Development was Emmanuel Entee teaching on spiritual formation, but what does that even mean? Spiritual formation is simply becoming more and more of a reflection on Jesus Christ.

On the first day we looked at the spiritual formation of Samuel in the Bible. Samuel grew up in a context of people who did not know God closely at all and were indifferent to him. Yet, he was formed by the intimate time he spent with God, his humility and his service to others. As he grew into a leader, people knew him for being authentic and credible, "He is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true." - 1 Samuel 9:6. We also see throughout Samuel's life that he was fully engaged in the society around him, he was not a guru that was distant from the world, he stayed relevant. His legacy from his spiritual formation is that he realigned the nation to godly values, influenced the country's power structures (King Saul and David) and led in hearing the voice of the Lord.

Later on in the week we talked about different spiritual disciplines to grow in our intimacy with God. A few examples are prayer, silence before God, journaling, studying the Bible and more. Lastly, Emmanuel taught on guidance and being resilient. This part impacted me the most, especially in three points to be attentive to when processing through guidance form the Lord. Be rooted in the unchanging nature of God and his Word when taking steps. Process through guidance in community of brothers and sisters in Christ. Reflect God's caring nature in following guidance.

As I continue in my walk with God, I will be open and vulnerable to him to allow him to work in my life and make me a better reflection of Christ each day.
