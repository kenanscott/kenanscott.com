The past couple of weeks I have really felt the need to make some adjustments to how I spend my time. Up until School of Ministry Devlopment I was pretty balanced but now I am attending the school and taking more responsibilities in IT at the same time as I will soon be the only person in IT.

This calls for some reshaping of my boundaries on my time, both in my work and self. What this means for work is using Do Not Disturb on my phone even more, and not understanding what is an IT emergency and what can actually wait. For myself, it means taking real rest like walking, watching the sunset over the English hills or talking with friends, instead of working every minute of the weekdays and watching YouTube all of the weekend. It's about having realistic expectations of what I am capable of doing and thinking about the big picture.

I have been reading Boundaries by Henry Cloud and John Townsend for the second time and was reminded of the importance of making boundaries in Christian fellowship, to not make them in a vacuum. I am now getting some help with being kept accountable for the boundaries I set, in order for me to live an abundant life!
