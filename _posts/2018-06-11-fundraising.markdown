Last week, Laura Mudd taught on fundraising in our School of Ministry Devlopment class. This was such a powerful teaching for me because it really showed me more of the spiritual elements behind fundraising and what I can do to communicate my vision better.

We can tend to dread fundraising and think of it as a neccesary evil to be able to be a missionary, but the truth is that it is good to be able to be supported by others. It builds relationships, accountability and faith. The structure that Youth With A Mission is wouldn't work without relying on God for our finances personally and not receiving a salary.

A big takeaway is that fundraising is not about us, or money, it's about God's vision for each of our lives. When I speak to someone about what I am doing in England, I can be bold about what God has called me to do, what support I need to see it happen and ask for someone to be a part of the vision, to send young people out into the nations and all parts of society with the Good News.

Another challenge that I had was to keep a proper budget, which I have now started. It was one of those things that I just overlooked in moving here but it really is important. I'm actually good at working with a budget and keeping financial records but I had not applied that to my own life before. I will keep an accurate ledger just as if it was someone else's money that I was working with, because it is God's money, not mine anyways.

I could keep writing about this week but I'm going to stop here for sake of time.
