Our lectures on Monday and Tuesday this week were on Biblical Worldview with Rebekah Hodder. A worldview is a set of assumpitons held consciously or unconsciously in faith about the makeup of the world and how it works. In essence, it is the story we tell to explain the world. There are many worldviews out there but the categories that we focused on were Biblical theism, Animism and secularism/humanism. Before we started looking at the specifics of these worldviews, we learned about how important it is to not just tell others truth, but to really live and share it through actions.

Even if we are Christians, it can be possible that we have a partial worldview rooted in something besides the Bible. This is one of the importances of studying worldview, so that we know what we believe and why, to cast off anything that isn't of God. We walked through four questions and how each worldview would answer them: what are the origins of everything? What is humanity? What is the world? What is our ultimate destiny? It was very helpful to me to hear the different worldviews and understand that biblical truth gives hope and redemption for humanity. We were created intentionally by a Creator God and we are co-laboring with him to bring restoration to all things.
