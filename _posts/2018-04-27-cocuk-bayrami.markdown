Last Sunday, I had the opprotunity to help facilitate a Çocuk Bayramı holiday for a Turkish-speaking church in London. This is a an annual children's holiday in Turkey to celebrate the people of the future. It has been celebrated in Turkey for about a hundred years now.

About ten of us from YWAM Harpenden went to the church by car, we set up in the church hall. Much Turkish food had been prepared, which was great to eat and provided lots of interesting tastes. We played games with the kids at first, had a dance competition and then finished with crafts. The craft that I helped with were paper plate face masks, other crafts were flower pots, cupcake decorating and colouring.

The event was a lot of fun and showed me more of what the church is like in London, especially for immigrants. The kids were full of energy and enjoyed the time that is set aside for them. It was also really good to meet with new people and hear their stories. I am really glad that I went and stepped out into something unknown. I hope to go back again sometime soon and continue in serving the Turkish people in London.
