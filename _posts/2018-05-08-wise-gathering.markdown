As we were cleaning up on Monday after the WISE (Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England) Gathering this past weekend, we were all engaged in various tasks. We had to clear lots of equipment and clean many different spaces around the Oval. I walked from the Clock Building over towards the marquee (a big tent), where there were others gathered waiting for jobs to do. As I approached, I saw that Makayla was standing between me and the others. She saw me walking in her general direction and what she did next was unexpected. Makayla raised her right arm and extended her hand to me, I could tell that she seemed tired and probably needed a boost. But at the same time, I needed to get to where I was going so that we could finish up the work for the day. Then, an idea struck me, I continued to walk her way, slightly to the left of her, but with even greater speed. As I got closer, I raised my right arm as well, grabbed her hand, let go and both of us were propelled in the opposite direction. What a strange story, it all happened in about fifteen seconds. I look at it as a physical example of how our class can work together to be propelled into God's calling for us, even if we aren't going in the same direction.
