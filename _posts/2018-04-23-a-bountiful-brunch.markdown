Here at YWAM Harpenden, staff and students live in several buildings around the campus. We do life together; working, eating, studying and having fun.

Today, Karen, a fellow staff member, invited me to brunch. Two others from the School of Ministry Development went as well as many from around the base. Wow, there was a lot of food, Karen is American and the selection reflected that. There was bacon, eggs, fruit, cookies, blueberries, cobbler, coffee and juice. We talked a little about new life, blueberries and breakfast.

I enjoy these times very much and in different ways. It is fun to be around friends and enjoy a meal together, we laugh quite a lot in these times. These times of being together is relaxing, especially after a long week. It is good to slow down after a week of being busy.

A deeper experience is that I feel closer to God when I am around other brothers and sisters in these times. I can see more of him when I can see him in the lives of believers. We have been learning this week about the importance of community in developing our spiritual foundation. The early church lived this out each day, they knew that they needed one another. "No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us." - 1 John 4:12.

To see the Father's face even more clearly, get to know a brother while eating bacon together.
