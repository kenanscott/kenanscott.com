On the School of Ministry Development, we have two small groups of students and staff that meet each Thursday. Each student takes a turn leading the small group in a creative way. This is a great time to be involved in a smaller group, to learn about God in a new way or just process the week with others. It is also a time when we can step out in leading a small group in innovative ways.

I enjoy this time each Thursday and look forward to it. At small group I can hear what others know about the heart of God and we can help ech other bceomemore like Christ. We only have a few more weeks of small group here in Harpenden left. But we will also be doing small groups and group times in Cornwall together. Part of my role on outreach is to coordinate these times, I won't be leading every time but will be making sure that someone is going to do it. I'm excited for the next phase of our journey as we go into Cornwall to love others as Christ loved us.
